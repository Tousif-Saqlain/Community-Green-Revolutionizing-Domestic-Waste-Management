# Community-Green: Revolutionizing-Domestic-Waste-Management

**<p align="center">Abstract</p>**
The project represents an evolution in waste management, with the goal of achieving a revolutionary approach that prioritises user-centricity. It offers an easy way for consumers to report local garbage issues via photo uploads, providing prompt and effective response to cleanliness concerns. It uses innovative technology to precisely identify waste locations, streamline household waste segregation, and provide specific disposal options. Furthermore, it swiftly alerts the nearest government authority for immediate action, demonstrating its dedication to expediting actions for a cleaner environment. The site includes tools that allow users to quickly follow cleanup schedules and incorporates a unique 'Social Score' system to encourage responsible behaviour and community engagement. Essentially, the initiative isn't only about reinventing waste management It is about creating a more sustainable and responsible future for communities. By emphasising user experience, it hopes to make garbage management more accessible, inclusive, and environmentally conscientious, with the goal of playing a key part in the development of cleaner, greener, and more eco-friendly neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the project promises to correctly detect trash locations, properly segregate home waste, make disposal recommendations using machine learning, allow users to easily track cleanup schedules, and create a 'Social Score' system in the future.

This Community-Green: Revolutionizing-Domestic-Waste-Management contains 3 modules

<u>1) Login Module</u>

•	User Authentication: To enable users, employees, and administrators to access the system, the login module offers authentication. To authenticate themselves, users must input their login ID and password.</br>
•	Access Control: Based on a user's role, the system routes them to their specific main account pages after a successful login. Because role-based access control is enforced by the system, every user is guaranteed the right permissions for the tasks at hand.</br>
•	Password Management: This module offers ways for users to safely reset or retrieve lost passwords. This may entail providing the user's registered email address or phone number with a recovery link or code.</br>
•	Session Management: For security reasons, the system keeps track of user sessions, including how long they take to log out, how long they stay logged in, and when an idle session ends.</br>

 <u>2) User Module</u>  
 
•	User Registration: Using this module, new users can create an account on the website by providing their contact details, name, and other required information.</br>
•	Uploading photographs: Users have the option to contribute photographs of trash problems by choosing from their device's storage or by scanning in real-time. The system might offer recommendations for the best possible image quality and the necessary data.</br>
•	Speedy Cleanup Requests: When users notice problems like overflowing trash cans or uncollected rubbish, they can submit requests for speedy cleanup. Requests are acknowledged by the system, which also offers a potential time frame for response.</br>
•	Work Approval: Using the system, users can verify and authorize the completion of a cleanup activity. This feedback loop aids the system in monitoring the caliber of the labor force's performance.</br>

•	Request Management: Workers receive and manage cleanup requests from users through the system. They can review the details of each request, including location, images, and urgency.</br>
•	Task Assignment: Workers can assign cleanup tasks to appropriate staff members, based on factors such as workload, expertise, and proximity to the location.</br>
•	Task Tracking: The system provides tools for workers to track the progress of assigned tasks and update their status (e.g., in progress, completed).</br>
•	Communication: Workers can communicate with users and other staff through the system to clarify details, confirm schedules, and provide updates on task completion.</br>

<u>4)	Admin  Module</u>

•	Administrator Control: By giving administrators access to all system parameters and controls through the dashboard, they can effectively oversee user accounts, roles, permissions, and other crucial setups.</br>
•	Data Monitoring: The dashboard allows administrators and staff to keep an eye on up-to-date information on cleanup requests, task progress, and system performance.</br>
•	Reports and Analytics: The dashboard module contains tools for creating reports and doing data analysis on several types of system activities, like user engagement and waste collection efficiency.</br>
•	Record Management: With the dashboard, staff members may keep track of user reports, maintenance logs, cleanup assignments, and performance indicators.</br>
•	Notifications and Alerts: Administrators and staff members can get alerts and notifications from the dashboard about significant system events, like user reports or modifications to task status.</br>
